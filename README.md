# Hackathon: Alberta Health Hack 2024

## Prompt 3: Mental Health

### **Idea**
 - The purpose of this application is to create a friendly game for younger children to teach them about proper coping with emotions so that it can equip them with the appropriate approach to navigating their emotions later on in their lives, especially in periods where statistics show youth are most prone to suicidal thoughts.

### **Technology**
 - Built using pygame in Python

### **Main Screen**
 - Users are first shown the game menu where they can choose how they are feeling
 - Based on this choice, a maze with a difficulty linked to the emotion is given to them

## **Mazes**
 - The program completely randomizes all mazes
 - There always is a path to the finish line
 - The end of the maze symbolizes being in touch with your emotions while the maze itself is the journey to it

### **Happy Maze**
 - The happy maze is the easiest to complete

### **Sad Maze**
 - The sad maze is a bit more complicated and involves the user needing to speak to an NPC to receive a key
 - The NPC symbolizes a trusted individual that you are speaking to a trusted individual about your feelings

### **Angry Maze**
 - The angry maze is the hardest maze to complete as it involves needing to backtrack to a separate objective (an NPC)
 - This NPC symbolizes a trusted individual that you can express your emotions to
